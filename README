Rhis looked greate and had all the needed information.  The navigation was simple as it should be for this project and the information about yourselft was organized in a reasonable way.  I liked the design and thought it looked professional.  There can always be things done to improve the appearance of something like this but overally it looked good.  I was not able to test the sizing since I only have one emulator but looking at the code, I think it should adjust just fine to any device.  I actually noticed some things I could change in my code after reviewing yours.  You make some notes on your code but a few more notes could be helpful in other people understanding.
